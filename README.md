# N_Resistor-Doping-and-Meshing
This project demonstrates how to create, mesh, and simulate an n-type resistor using Synopsys Sentaurus Device (SDE) and visualize the resulting doping profile and mesh with SVisual. It includes an example SDE deck, recommended mesh/refinement settings, sample input for implant doping, and instructions for opening/inspecting results in SVisual.
